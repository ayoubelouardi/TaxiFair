# 🧭 Dalil (دليل) - Brand Guidelines

> **"Minimalist Tech, Timeless Guidance."**

Dalil is a lightweight, client-side transportation pricing engine. It prioritizes speed, privacy, and cultural resonance, functioning entirely without a backend to provide instant fare calculations and route guidance.

## 1. Brand Essence

### Meaning
**Dalil (دليل)**: In Arabic, the word translates to "Guide," "Proof," or "Evidence." It represents clarity in a complex city landscape.

### Core Pillars
* **Privacy by Design:** No backend means the user's data never leaves their device.
* **Cultural Roots:** Deeply inspired by Arabic calligraphy and geometric art.
* **Zero Friction:** Lightweight, static, and instant.

## 2. Visual Identity

### The Logo Concept
The visual mark should focus on the Arabic letter **د (Dal)**.
* **Style:** Modern Geometric Kufic.
* **Metaphor:** The curves of the script should mimic a road or a path.
* **The "Nuqta" (Dot):** A single dot placed strategically to represent a "Destination" on a map.

### Color Palette
| Color | Hex | Role | Cultural Significance |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Navigator Indigo** | `#1A237E` | Primary | The night sky used by ancient travelers. |
| **Heritage Gold** | `#C5A059` | Accent | Desert sands and traditional craftsmanship. |
| **Static White** | `#F5F5F5` | Background | Cleanliness, speed, and minimalism. |
| **Zellige Teal** | `#008080` | UI Elements | Traditional Moroccan tilework; modern tech vibe. |

### Typography
* **Arabic:** *Readex Pro* or *Amiri*. (Readex offers a clean, geometric look that fits a tech app).
* **Latin:** *Inter* or *Montserrat*. (High legibility for data-heavy pricing tables).

## 3. Brand Voice & Messaging

### Tone of Voice
* **Direct:** No unnecessary fluff (reflecting the codebase).
* **Hospitable:** Like a local friend showing you the way.
* **Reliable:** Precise and mathematical.

### Taglines
* **English:** "Your city, decoded."
* **Arabic:** "طريقك، بكل بساطة" (Your path, with all simplicity).

## 4. UI/UX Principles (The "Static" Look)

Since Dalil has no database, the UI should feel **instant**.
1.  **Geometric Patterns:** Use subtle, low-opacity Islamic geometric patterns (Girih) as background watermarks.
2.  **Skeuomorphic Touches:** Use shadows that mimic the desert sun (sharp, high-contrast).
3.  **RTL First:** The layout must be optimized for Right-to-Left flow, ensuring the Arabic script feels native, not "translated."
